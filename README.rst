Cilium Microscope
=================

Cilium microscope allows you to see ``cilium monitor`` output from all your cilium nodes.
This allows you to have one simple to use command to interact with your cilium nodes
within k8s cluster.


Running microscope in your Kubernetes cluster
---------------------------------------------

``kubectl run -i --tty microscope --image cilium/microscope --restart=Never -- sh`` will run a shell inside a pod in your cluster.

``./microscope -h`` inside this shell will show ``microscope`` help.


Running microscope locally
--------------------------

To run ``microscope`` locally, you need to have Python 3.5 or newer installed. Using virtualenv is recommended, but not necessary.

``microscope`` is available as a package in PyPI, so all you need to do is run ``pip install cilium-microscope``. ``microscope`` executable should be available in your path.

Alternatively you can run ``make`` to build self-contained Python archive which will container all dependencies and requires only Python to run.

The archive will be located in ``dist/microscope.pyz``, and should be executable directly.
